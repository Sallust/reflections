?What do you think about var function?
 - Thank god for some f'in variables. It's odd how much I missed having variables while using HTML & CSS


?What do you think about [string].replace([old],[new]) function?
 - Seems OK. I'm enjoying how the syntax seems very similar to python
 - I see it only changes the first instance of [old]

?How do you feel about this learning set-up?
 - I might be overdoing it between the reflections and the 2 different google docs (1 for code, 1 for any links)
 - my hope is that now, I won't have to re-watch any videos.
 - If that comes to be true, I think it will be worth it. Re-watching the HTML courses again was pretty painful.

?How did you get "audacity" to "Udacity" using js?
 - sure would have been nice if they mentioned concatenation and [] are the same as Python

?Truthy vs Falsy? Thoughts?
 - Similar to python, seems powerful enough.
  - I think it's weird we're learning this before if statements, though.

?Arrays?
 - So these are just lists right?
 - manipulating them in python seemed more intuitive
 - array.pop() is just a cluster... it returns the last value while simultaneously removing it
  - Manipulating strings & arrays seems similar to python.

?Objects?
 - These just seem unwieldy and useless.
 - I hope their value becomes more apparent as the course progresses
 - I guess I do like being able to store a lot of data
