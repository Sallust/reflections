?What do you think about var function?
 - Thank god for some f'in variables. It's odd how much I missed having variables while using HTML & CSS


?What do you think about [string].replace([old],[new]) function?
 - Seems OK. I'm enjoying how the syntax seems very similar to python
 - I see it only changes the first instance of [old]
