?What do you think about var function?
 - Thank god for some f'in variables. It's odd how much I missed having variables while using HTML & CSS


?What do you think about [string].replace([old],[new]) function?
 - Seems OK. I'm enjoying how the syntax seems very similar to python
 - I see it only changes the first instance of [old]

?How do you feel about this learning set-up?
 - I might be overdoing it between the reflections and the 2 different google docs (1 for code, 1 for any links)
 - my hope is that now, I won't have to re-watch any videos.
 - If that comes to be true, I think it will be worth it. Re-watching the HTML courses again was pretty painful.

?How did you get "audacity" to "Udacity" using js?
 - sure would have been nice if they mentioned concatenation and [] are the same as Python

?Truthy vs Falsy? Thoughts?
 - Similar to python, seems powerful enough.
  - I think it's weird we're learning this before if statements, though.

?Arrays?
 - So these are just lists right?
 - manipulating them in python seemed more intuitive
 - array.pop() is just a cluster... it returns the last value while simultaneously removing it
  - Manipulating strings & arrays seems similar to python.

?Objects?
 - These just seem unwieldy and useless.
 - I hope their value becomes more apparent as the course progresses
 - I guess I do like being able to store a lot of data

?How are objects and variables different?
 - an object IS a variable?
 - declaring object properties is distinct from creating a new variable

?What is object declaration?
 - generating a new key or property to an object. This can be done via initial {} notation, dot notation, or [] notation
 - Seems like a lot. Seems [] would be useful for using more chars
 - pretty cool that you can initialize as one and call it via the other

 ?Why is JSON Linting important?
  - Sublime won't catch errors
  - JSON errors would seem to abort the whole script... which is kind of annoying


?Why is JSON important?
 - capability to store tons of data
 - using JSONP you can cross domain barriers...
 -so you can use some combo of AJAX and jquery  which I guess sounds pretty cool,
 - but I'm really not sure I have a clue what it means

?Closing Thoughts?
 - Seems restrictive in the way I'm having to save the data, but hopefully that's for the sake of ease of data manipulation later
 - In having to compile a list of completed courses, I realized I have taken a lot and should take some consolation in getting through them all :-p
 - In compiling this list, I realized I should be reading the initial course descriptions to give me a better idea of how the course will be organized, what I will learn, and possibly where the meat/most time-consuming part of the course will be.
