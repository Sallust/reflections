?What is scope?
 - defines from where a variable will be accessible
 - outside of a function, a variable will have global scope
 - inside of a function, a variable will have local scope

?How will this affect how you can write code?
 - will have to be very careful when using "var" w/in functions
  - actually, it should be clear hopefully whether or not I want to create a new local variable or access/change a global one


?What is block level scope?
 - w/in an "if" block


?How do if statements relate to scope?
 - they do not have their own scope.
 - There is no way to create a local variable w/in an if statement

 ?Is there a difference in Function Declaration Syntax?
  - hell yes there is.
  - I'm not sure I understand how the computer does it, but using function myFunc magically sets function for everything even before
  - using var myFunc only introduces an undefined variable to be later defined when line is reached

?Overcoming new syntax barriers?
 - Have GOT to get stronger at understanding documentation
 - in last problem we used the infoWindow class? open to create an info window above pin points on event
 - overall, pretty cool

?Using JS to do programy things?
 - This is cool but it makes me scared that I might actually like a more back-end degree...
