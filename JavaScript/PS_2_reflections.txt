?What is scope?
 - defines from where a variable will be accessible
 - outside of a function, a variable will have global scope
 - inside of a function, a variable will have local scope

?How will this affect how you can write code?
 - will have to be very careful when using "var" w/in functions
  - actually, it should be clear hopefully whether or not I want to create a new local variable or access/change a global one


?What is block level scope?
 - w/in an "if" block


?How do if statements relate to scope?
 - they do not have their own scope.
 - There is no way to create a local variable w/in an if statement

 ?Is there a difference in Function Declaration Syntax?
  - hell yes there is.
  - I'm not sure I understand how the computer does it, but using function myFunc magically sets function for everything even before
  - using var myFunc only introduces an undefined variable to be later defined when line is reached

?Overcoming new syntax barriers?
 - Have GOT to get stronger at understanding documentation
 - in last problem we used the infoWindow class? open to create an info window above pin points on event
 - overall, pretty cool

?Using JS to do programy things?
 - This is cool but it makes me scared that I might actually like a more back-end degree...

 -HA! I can't believe I wrote that yesterday.
 - This was painful, lol.

?Using JS to parse PageInsights data?
 -It's still stunning to me that in a for loop the variable only refers to the index and not the value
 -It's really annoying, but I figured it out
 -I do wish there were a more generic way of sifting through objects kind of like an index
 -The only hard part was figuring out the above and applying it to solution

?Using JS to total the bytes?
 - Still not 100% sure why .Numbers() didn't work, but I developed a work around
 -Can I really not set two variables at a time? That's lame
 - I'll have to play with this later
 -Again, can see power of JavaScript. It's OK
