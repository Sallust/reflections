?if statements? awesome, right?
 - finally we get some power

?linking methods? also pretty awesome, right?
 -making huge strings of code actually seems better than python
 - writing this code in Python I think would have been a lot more complicated?
 - $("#skills").append(HTMLskills.replace("%data%",bio.skills.join(" ")));

?for loops and while loops?
 - seem fine and comporable to python, BUT, it's a little annoying that the item in a for in loop refers to the index and not the actualy item

?How fun was it trying to figure out how to reference the correct JSON element?
 - It wasn't.
 I'm still unsure why there's a jobs array within the work object.
 - At some point I'd like to play around and see if it gets harder to reference NOT using their format

? Collecting Click Locations?
 - This exercise seemed a little random and weird.
 - Hopefully they run through it further
 - Seemed like an illogical step
 -However, let this be a lesson that you can always find the answer on stack overflow :-)

?Internationalize Name?
 - Thank god for message boards!!
 - Per discussion w/ Nuatu, really should be using these more often

?Encapsulation?
 - I like the idea of neat code
 - I think I'll have to see an example of fully encapsulized code to fully grasp the beauty of it

?Anonymous Functions?
 - I'm honestly not 100% sure I fully grasp the idea, but I think w/ time it will become more clear

?Final Thoughts?
 - JS seems alright
  - The google map seems like it was just magically handed to us
  - So I'll have to dig into code to better understand it
  - I hope I don't get too caught up in personalizing the website :-p
  - I'm ready to jump into the project and start making the JS code my own...
  -After I look forward to making it not look super boring
