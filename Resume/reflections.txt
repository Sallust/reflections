?How have I approached Resume writing before?
	-polishing of an old resume that was "perfected" by my Harvard OCS officer
	-I last updated my Resume relatively recently when I considered working at GAP when I left J.Crew
	-I update my resume only when I absolutely need to
	-Need to include new programming things
	-I like the format and the verbage of my current resume

Mind Blown: It is NOT appropriate to include the year I graduated a degree program

?What are the major resume sections to include in the Master Resume?
	-Heading
	-Skills
	-Projects
	-Relevant Experience
	-Education
	-Interests
