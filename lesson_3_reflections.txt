?When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

 - when you want to share projects w/ classmate and/or the world
 - when you want to be able to access it from different devices

?Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 - when multiple people are working on files, you wouldn't want files to automatically do anything really out from under you

  when you clone a repository, git automatically sets up the remote to the repository you cloned from

?Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 - fork- when you want to get all up in someone else's code without it screwing their version up

 - clone- pretty boring... a direct  copy. after forking you'll want to clone the forked remote to your device

 - branch vs. fork: similar concepts but you make branches but you take forks?

?What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

 - by fetching it you are then able to review differences collaborators have made

  - in the class example, I would have been able to contemplate "sarah's" deletion of cumin from the recipe. Obviously this is a crime, so I will be revoking sarah's ability to collaborate.

?How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

 - I think this is supposed to be the "aha moment" reflection
 - it would be difficult to gracefully communicate (w/ line by line comments) to another person
 - hypothetically, if I used google docs to collaborate, it would be easier mostly due to familiarity
 - however, there's not really a "hey come look at my work" function so comments like "here's a typo" would become part of the clutter

Use pull requests... don't be rude!

?When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

 - by definition it seems, a pull request is a change you're uncertain about and want feedback on so it would make sense not to have these commits directly on the master
  - also it seems a natural progression to start a branch and then delete it once merged
  - if you don't make a branch, it seems you could end up messing up the master
