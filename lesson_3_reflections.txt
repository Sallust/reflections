?When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

 - when you want to share projects w/ classmate and/or the world
 - when you want to be able to access it from different devices

?Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 - when multiple people are working on files, you wouldn't want files to automatically do anything really out from under you

  when you clone a repository, git automatically sets up the remote to the repository you cloned from

?Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
 - fork- when you want to get all up in someone else's code without it screwing their version up

 - clone- pretty boring... a direct  copy. after forking you'll want to clone the forked remote to your device

 - branch vs. fork: similar concepts but you make branches but you take forks?

?What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

 - by fetching it you are then able to review differences collaborators have made

  - in the class example, I would have been able to contemplate "sarah's" deletion of cumin from the recipe. Obviously this is a crime, so I will be revoking sarah's ability to collaborate.
