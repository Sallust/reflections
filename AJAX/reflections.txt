?How does AJAX change how you can load a custom content page?

	-Start rendering generic 
	-and finish up by rendering unique html
	Facebook employs this technique

?What did we learn in this course?
	-How to make asyncronous requests!
	-Basically, how you get information for the page after you've already started loading it
	-This course primarily focused on API's, I'm curirous about how you can use AJAX to populate the rest of a page-
	-If I had to guess,  I'd say that companies like facebook have a huge API like set up that provides them the information for the rest of the web site
	-Then the information is populated into the page the same way that I was able to populate images and websites into the project website for the course
