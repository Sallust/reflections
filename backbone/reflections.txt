?How did you feel about the Getting Started-backbone intro?
	-Seems ok
	-It strikes me as a little minimalist, but in their eyes, that's a good thing
	-some of the language I don't quite get yet, but that's not a huge deal "atomic bla bla bla"'
	-I'm glad that we got to work with knockout first to see how another type of library handles the MVMM model
	-I'm excited to get started since the backbone.js example in the JSdesign course was the easiest for me to jump into

?What did you learn from making your first Backbone App?
	-There are all sorts of crazy methods going on
	-you need to call get to get a value
	-call set to set it
	-$el is a reference to the dom elements of the view
	-there are lots of different separate pieces
	-This use of Model seems more in line with what Eric was mentioning

	-Service Model--> Kind of like a constructor function
		-contains data and also a nice helper function to toggle checked
	-ServiceList Collection--> like an observable array
		-model property declares what it's a collection of?
		-function getChecked returns array of checked services
		-uses 'where'

	-Then create a new Collection of new Services

	-ServiceView View --> The ViewModel
		declare tagname?
		events: on this do this
		initialize: sets up listening by this.listenTo
		listenTo (this.model, change, this.render)

		render: sets html using $el
	-App View --> Like the Mother of the Views
		-first set "el", which is where it lives
		-initialize selectors
		-sets up Listening (what's being listening to, for what, what to do)
		-initialize each subViewModel using passing {model:service} as param
		-add render of each service

		-its Render calculates total and dynamically changes it in DOM
