?What are you going to learn in this course?
	-Seems like a lot
	-Also seems like we're going to cover some of the gaps that I've had to just push through
	-I hope to be able to read code a little better and without as much indimidation
	

?Cat Clicker Ap? How hard & how do you feel about code?
	-I feel ok about my code. I'm a little embarassed about how long it took me to set up JQuery in the right order and in the right place
	-

?Cat Clicker 2?
	-I'm not sure that was the best way to duplicate the code
	-At least it was easier because I reused the same commands from the first ap

?What's really happening with in the for loop and alert example?	
	-The creation of 3 new elements
	-the creation of an alert to the current value of the variable 
	-the variable at the end of the loop is 3 so all alerts point to 3
