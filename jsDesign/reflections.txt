?What are you going to learn in this course?
	-Seems like a lot
	-Also seems like we're going to cover some of the gaps that I've had to just push through
	-I hope to be able to read code a little better and without as much indimidation


?Cat Clicker Ap? How hard & how do you feel about code?
	-I feel ok about my code. I'm a little embarassed about how long it took me to set up JQuery in the right order and in the right place
	-

?Cat Clicker 2?
	-I'm not sure that was the best way to duplicate the code
	-At least it was easier because I reused the same commands from the first ap
	-

?What's really happening with in the for loop and alert example?
	-The creation of 3 new elements
	-the creation of an alert to the current value of the variable
	-the variable at the end of the loop is 3 so all alerts point to 3

?How do you feel about your code?
	-it's a mess
	-if I had to do it all over again, I'd try to organize it better
	-It's feeling a little more flexible than the first two answers

?Where are you now regarding your code abilities?
	-Like a guy with wood and powertools and no plans
	-I've learned and have the tools to build websites and aps but maybe not the organization just yet
	-Separating out the project into smaller pieces makes it easier to build
	-Separation of concerns also allows for easier updates later
	-For the love of Christ, use google!!!!
	-There really is absolutely no point for me to try and recreate the wheel
	-google solutions and find out the best practices
	-Why try to build a weird dodocagon when the pattern for building a wheel exisits

What are the goals of organization?
	-Code is stable & bug-free
	-cleanly written
	-scale well
	-are extensible

?Telephone example?
	-When everything is connected, you can't move anything around
	-Connections = Complexity

?What is the Octopus?
	-The thing that holds things together
	-but ALSO keeps them separate enough so we can change them without disturbing everything else

?Calendar Quiz-Which of the following would be part of the mode?
	*The array of calendar events in the application
	-the buttons for day etc.
	-The render function for the calendar area (since this determines the view)

?YouTube Playlist Ap- Which of these are in the View?
	*The input element
	-The array of URLs to play
	-The function that adds a URL to the list-(part of the Octopus)
	*The area where a video plays

?Pizza Clicker Ap?
	-Seriously, I cloned a repo just for a metaphor?
	-takeaways: separation of view and model concerns

?Udacity Retain Ap?
	-How is it organized?
		-into 3 functions: model, octopus and view
		-model organizes data
		-octopus facilitates communication between the two
		-view takes data given by octopus and renders it
		-There is no direct communication between method and vie

?If we wanted to reverse order of tags where would that functionality go?
	-in the Octopus!
	-Why?
		-We don't want to or need to mess with the data that we already have
		-We can simply change the way the view is getting the data from the mode

?How is Andy displaying the cat when you click each of the buttons? What's wrong with this?
	-by creating and then showing and hiding them
	-This isn't great because if we had 1000 cats we'd have 1000 DOM nodes

?Where is the model or data stored in this ap?
	-It's stored in the DOM
	-So I actually think it's clever. I'm interested to see exactly why this is a bad practice

?Cat Clicker Premium Solution-Reflections?
	-solution addressed some issues I came into cleverly
	-e.g. in view object, I wanted to set Dom variables only once
	-answer achieved this by setting variable to this.variable (duh!)
	-other big takeaway: when to store a property in the object itself
	-i.e. setting an imgDisplay property to false was a little awkward
	-better solution was to simply create a model.displayedCat that would change.
?What did you learn through attendance click ap and refactoring own resume project?
	-I still feel like I'm missing a small part of the logic here.
	-Was starting to get the hang of things when refactoring the resume project code
	-Also, feel like my code for the resume is a hot mess that I will actually need to clean up even further :-(
?Isn't it lazy to just use other people's libraries?
	-No, there is no need to rebuild what has already been built
	-Use the pieces that already exist and are well tested to build an even better project

?What is knockout?
	-an organizational framework
	-big

?Documentation & Looking stuff up?
	-don't be afraid to look things up
	-it's the programming decisions that you make that determine your success as a developer NOT your ability to randomly recall functions quickly

?How are jQuery and knockout similar?
	-observables and observablAArrays are simply functions with special keys and methods on them

?When would you use a computed observable?
	-First, a computed observable is a variable created from other variables e.g. full name
	-in the cat example, you'd use it for Full name (based on first and last name)
	-and you'd used it for a Cat Title based on the number of clicks.

?What's Control Flow and why does it sound so scary?
	-it's just anything that's non-linear so like a for loop
