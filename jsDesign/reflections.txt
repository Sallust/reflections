?What are you going to learn in this course?
	-Seems like a lot
	-Also seems like we're going to cover some of the gaps that I've had to just push through
	-I hope to be able to read code a little better and without as much indimidation
	

?Cat Clicker Ap? How hard & how do you feel about code?
	-I feel ok about my code. I'm a little embarassed about how long it took me to set up JQuery in the right order and in the right place
	-

?Cat Clicker 2?
	-I'm not sure that was the best way to duplicate the code
	-At least it was easier because I reused the same commands from the first ap
	-

?What's really happening with in the for loop and alert example?	
	-The creation of 3 new elements
	-the creation of an alert to the current value of the variable 
	-the variable at the end of the loop is 3 so all alerts point to 3

?How do you feel about your code?
	-it's a mess
	-if I had to do it all over again, I'd try to organize it better
	-It's feeling a little more flexible than the first two answers

?Where are you now regarding your code abilities?
	-Like a guy with wood and powertools and no plans
	-I've learned and have the tools to build websites and aps but maybe not the organization just yet
	-Separating out the project into smaller pieces makes it easier to build
	-Separation of concerns also allows for easier updates later
	-For the love of Christ, use google!!!!
	-There really is absolutely no point for me to try and recreate the wheel
	-google solutions and find out the best practices 
	-Why try to build a weird dodocagon when the pattern for building a wheel exisits

What are the goals of organization?
	-Code is stable & bug-free
	-cleanly written
	-scale well
	-are extensible

?Telephone example?
	-When everything is connected, you can't move anything around
	-Connections = Complexity

?What is the Octopus?
	-The thing that holds things together
