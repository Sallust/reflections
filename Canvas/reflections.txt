?What is the canvas?
	-Just the physical space where the drawing will occur

?How does the Canvas coordinate system compare to geometry class?
	-it does NOT use Cartesian PLanes!!!
	-Origin is top left, with a coordinate of (0,0)
	-x axis is same, in that increasing x coordinate moves right
	-HOWEVER, y is opposite in that increasing y coordinates move DOWN

?Why do we need to set a an event listener for image load?
	-all images in jS load asynchronously
	-so we can only work with image once it's finished loading
	-hence the image.onload

?Why do we need to set up a local host?
	-Error "Tainted canvases may not be exported"
	-Bootleg way around this issue is to right click save

?Why does changing height, reset the canvas?


?Order of Operations?
	-Scale, Rotate, Translate
	-Transformations apply for all subsequent objects until reversed

?What's in the Image Data object?
	- width, height, data (Uint8Clamped Array)
	-U = unsigned and thus all positive
	-int8 means 0-255 number system

How do we
