?What did you learn from this webcast?
 - new strategies and habits
 - what a FE job actually looks like
 - what next steps to take after my FE degree

?How did this Webcast make you feel about your future job prospects?
 - generally assuaged fear of not being prepared enough to start a job.
 - by somewhat outlining next steps after my FE degree
 - also: EVERYTHING ON WEB IS EITHER HTML, CSS, or JS
 - any sort of framework is just a manipulations of the above 3
 - so there's something to be said for getting really good at those 3


?How will you apply what you learned to when you're working as a FE-intern?
 - There's a time to explore crazy new ideas and concepts
 - This is NOT the case when you have a deadline.
 - I think this is huge for me as I constantly fear there being some better solution out there
 - If you can solve it with what you know and it's well supported that very well may be the best solution
 - Some newfangled framework might be nice... but not when you get woken up at 3 in the morning because you're the only one who knows how it works.


?What surprised you the most?
 - simply divided IT world into Web Dev and Software Field

?What changes are you going to start making now?
 - Start reading hackerNews and WebDesignerNews
 - hackerNews more tech, bus & comp sci
 - hackerNews good place to stay on top of developing trends
 - not very Tutorial-y

?Any good strategic takeaways?
 - Taking popularity of a framework or new something is fine
 - It speaks to support
 - also make sure to check that documentation exists
 - see if Stack Overflow had a lot of questions about it.
 - when diving into a new Code Base, don't feel anxious to understand EVERY bit of it
  - It's sufficient just to understand just the parts that relate to your project
  - Don't be afraid to ask questions: sometimes a human can answer your question a lot faster than google can

?Good FE principles?
 - Design - how to pull in new Users
 - Content - how to keep Users
 - Don't interrupt the flow of the User


?Why will Adobe Fail?
 - It broke rule 3 above: interrupting  the flow of the user
 - you can't copy paste in adobe
 - you can't tab through
 - generally it's a big blob on the page that you can't interact with
 - it's a great design, but a poor User experience is why it will fail


?How to get Design inspiration?
 - Just go to other websites!!!
 - Check out the library being imported!!
 - explore WHAT makes a design bad or good
 - Things like parallax scrolling are big now.
 - I think the rtve website relies heavily on those (go spain!
 )

?New Advanced WebDev Nanodegree components?
 - Angular JS: a collaboration with google
 - Polymer
 - Gulp or Grunt work
 -ES 6 maybe (whatever that is)

?Other courses?
 - Design of Everyday Things
 - also a book
 - Donald Norman

? What are steps you could take now?
 - putting up any sort of work in a public space
 - blogging
 - sharing something

? Next steps?
 - create a ToDo application
 - 2 way data binding
 - take existing portfolio Resume and Map and recreate using one of the newer frameworks
 - Learn Angular and Google Ap Engine
