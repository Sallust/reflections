?Why should you also test performance directly on phones?
	-Issues with CPU, memory, connectivity that would only show up on a phone
	-given phones have much less of the above

?Good testing strategies to collect clean data?
	-Quit other apps
	-go Incognito (so extensions don't skew results)
	-Causes not symptoms-identify the reasons for issues and focus on them
	-Measure first then optimize (to see marginal change)

?Where was the jank?
	-look for scripting that would cause the frames to run long
	-This example still feels confusing though
	-The big purple bars indicate too much layout is happening
	-so identify how layout is being called

?Where was the jank in circle box?
	-As soon as you open it, it's a lot of green indicated a paint problem
	-You know it's caused by JS because it green bar only occurs after RequestAnimationFrame is fired

?What is a micro-Optimization?
	-changing small bits of JS code
	-you CAN'T do this because there is no way to tell exactly how the JS engine will run the code. 

?So how do you optimize JS code?
	- by using RequestAnimationFrame which fires as early as possible 

function animate() {
	//something rad
	requestAnimationFrame(animate);
}
requestAnimationFrame(animate);

?What does checking the JS profiler box do?
	- Enhances amount of JavaScript that you see in timeline recording
	- should really only use JS profiler when you know you have a problem with long running JavaScript
